## Prompts

### Reading Response 1

Briefly summarize Macdonald's social and political history of the ACS with a short paragraph in your own words. Then, in your own experience, reflect on how data collection, gathering, and interpretation are influenced by wider social, political, and cultural contexts and undercurrents.

### Reading Response 2

What are descriptive statistics useful for? How can they be used to mislead? Provide an example from your own experience of a time when descriptive statistics were used to deceive or mislead the public, whether intentionally or unintentionally (consider recent news stories, political issues, advocacy groups, etc).

### Reading Response 3

What are Tufte's key lessons for effective data visualization and why? Provide an example from your own experience of an excellent visualization in the real world: what did it do and how did it do it well? Then do the same for a bad visualization in your opinion. Consider sources from the news, politics, research, etc.

### Reading Response 4

What are the ethical implications of spatial data visualization and why does Gimond (in agreement with Tukey) suggest that maps can serve the purpose of propaganda? Where does spatial data analysis/visualization fit within the specific questions/projects you hope to address in your career?

### Reading Response 5

First, respond to just 1 of the following 2 prompts (approx 1/2 page):

  1. What is inductive inference and why it is useful despite its flaws?
  2. What is an anti-realist? Are you one?

Then respond to the following prompt (approx 1/2 page): thinking about your group's final project (or another research project you're affiliated with) reflect on how you might use scientific inference to understand or explain the phenomenon you are investigating (you can consider deduction, induction, IBE, causation, etc -- whatever is relevant or useful to you).

### Reading Response 6

What claims did the Wall Street Journal article make and why did their evidence not support those claims? Humans tend to have a hard time reasoning with and expressing uncertainty: reflect on an example from your own experience of a time that someone made a prediction or developed a policy without properly dealing with their own uncertainty. Did it have any unforeseen/unintended consequences or negative ramifications? What could they have done differently, given only what they knew at the time?

### Reading Response 7

First, respond to just 1 of the following 2 prompts (approx 1/2 page):

  1. When can we feel safe making claims about causation?
  2. What dangers lie in making causal claims and why must we be careful as data-driven storytellers?

Then respond to the following prompt (approx 1/2 page): describe an example from your school/work/personal life where a causal claim was made, but shouldn't have been. Why was it inappropriate for the speaker/writer to imply causation?

### Reading Response 8

What is Kitchin's main argument about smart city technology and urban research? In your own experience, what is an example of a smart city technology that caused a social harm? Whom did this technology harm and for whom was it good? Reflect on its creators' intentions and how they fell short of advancing the public good.
