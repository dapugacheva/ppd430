# Group Assignment 3: Data Visualization

See the schedule in the syllabus for all assignment due dates and expectations. Submissions are due by 23:59 on their due date. Group assignments need only one submission per group, so nominate a single submitter to submit on behalf of the whole group. You will be graded on your adherence to *all* the instructions. Please read the instructions carefully.

You will visualize the data you downloaded in assignment 1. Create a new Jupyter notebook. The first cell of your notebook should be markdown explaining where you found your data set and what it contains.

Use pandas to load your data set and clean/process it as needed. Identify at least two variables of interest and calculate relevant descriptive statistics. Using the techniques we learned in class, visualize interesting aspects of your data set. Next, in total, you will create at least 4 visualizations using at least 3 different visualization types (such as bar charts, line charts, scatter plots, or anything else). 1 of your visualizations should be a "bad" visualization (that is, does not follow best practices) and the next one should be an improvement of it.

Each visualization should be followed by a markdown cell that succinctly explains what you are visualizing and why it is interesting. What story does it tell? How do the visuals enrich, confirm, or contradict the descriptive statistics you calculated earlier? For the "bad" visualization and its improvement, explain what's wrong with the former and how you improved it with the latter.

At the end of the notebook, include a markdown cell that identifies each group member and describes their contribution to this assignment (one sentence each).

Make sure your notebook runs from the top without any errors and that all the visuals can be seen inline (without me having to re-run your notebook). Then submit your notebook and your data file(s), zipped, via Blackboard.
