# Group Assignment 1: Collecting Data

See the schedule in the syllabus for all assignment due dates and expectations. Submissions are due by 23:59 on their due date. Group assignments need only one submission per group, so nominate a single submitter to submit on behalf of the whole group. You will be graded on your adherence to *all* the instructions. Please read the instructions carefully.

This course's final project requires you to identify a research question, collect data, analyze it, and discuss how your findings answer the question.

For this assignment, you will agree on a semester-long research topic and question for your group. This can be tweaked somewhat as the semester goes on, if needed, but for now I want you to have at least a working research topic and question. As an example, your research topic might be "transportation justice" and your question might be "are low-income communities subjected to more vehicular pollution than high-income communities, even though they tend to drive less?"

Next you will identify and download datasets from at least two different sources (for example, the census bureau and the LA city data portal) that you believe will help you answer this question. If you cannot find data from two sources to address your question, then it is likely not an appropriate question for the purposes of this course. At least one of your datasets must have a spatial component (such as latitude-longitude points, or building footprints, or census tracts, or anything else explicitly "spatial").

Write a 2-3 page paper (single-spaced, 12-point Times New Roman font) that does the following. First, explain your research topic, its context, and its importance (establish the overarching issue or concern). Second, state and explain your research question and any expectations you have going into it. Third, document the datasets you have downloaded, including 1) the data sources; 2) the data contents such as variable names, descriptions, and units of analysis; 3) how you believe these data could help you answer your research question over the course of the semester. Submit this paper as a PDF.
