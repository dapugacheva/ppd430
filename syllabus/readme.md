# Course Description

This course empowers you to consume, produce, and evaluate urban data to better interpret and tell urban stories. It will introduce basic coding, visualization, and data processing and analysis. The course uses Python and Jupyter notebooks to introduce coding and statistical methods that students can reproduce and experiment with in real-time in the classroom. We start the semester with the basics of coding, then move on to data loading and analysis, then visualization and mapping, and then a critical assessment urban informatics as a field.

Each week, students will be expected to:

  - Complete and be prepared to discuss all assigned readings
  - Complete and submit any assigned individual reflections
  - Attend the lecture
  - Complete and submit any assignments

The course has no specific prerequisites. Coding itself will be taught from the ground-up. However, this course requires patience and practice: learning to code will take lots of trial-and-error, self-direction, repetition, and experimentation on your part. You will get out of it what you are willing to put into it. Please note that this syllabus is a living document and may be updated by the instructor during the semester as needed.



# Learning Objectives

  - Basic coding in Python
  - Collect urban data from the web and APIs
  - Explore, wrangle, clean, transform, and merge data
  - Visualize and map urban data
  - Conduct basic statistical analyses



# Questions and Assistance

I am available if you need help throughout the semester and am happy to answer your questions. Please ask course-related questions in our course's Slack channel: you should expect a reply typically within two working days. If you have a sensitive personal matter to discuss, please ask by email. Office hours info is provided at the beginning of the syllabus.

Given the nature of this course, I do expect a few things of you before you seek assistance with coding/data questions:

  1. Close all open programs, restart your computer, then try your task again
  2. Search Google and StackOverflow for the topic/problem (for example, the name of the function you're struggling with or the error message you are seeing)
  3. Go back through the relevant lecture materials to look for any insights
  4. Go back through the assigned reading materials to look for any insights
  5. Ask your teammates if they have any insight

If the above steps haven't solved your problem, post on Slack (or attend office hours) and include the following information:

  1. A detailed description of what you're trying to do, why, and how
  2. A complete [minimal reproducible example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example) of your code so far (never send screenshots of code/tracebacks)
  3. What you've already tried to do to solve your problem and what you have learned from it so far (specifically, explain the results of steps 1-4 above, including relevant links from StackOverflow etc)

I do not ask for this to be pedantic. Rather, I need it to be able to help you solve your problem.



# Materials

Coursework will be based on free open-source software.

Copyrighted course reading materials are available via Blackboard for enrolled students to download. The course lectures assume that you have read the assigned readings prior to the class session and are now reasonably fluent in their contents and ready to discuss/debate them in class.



# Assignments and Evaluation

Per USC guidelines, for each course unit the university expects 2 hours of out-of-class student work per week. This is a 4 unit course. Therefore, you should expect an average of 8 hours of out-of-class work each week: please budget your time accordingly. The balance will vary from week to week, but will comprise a mix of individual reading, individual writing, and group data/code assignments. See the schedule below for assignment due dates and see the "assignments" folder for instructions. Active participation is expected (and graded) in the classroom.

Final grades will be weighted as follows:

  - 20%: six individual reflections
  - 30%: five group exercises
  - 20%: individual midterm exam
  - 20%: final group project and presentation
  - 10%: active participation in classroom/Slack and team work

Assignments must be submitted via Blackboard by 23:59 pacific time on their due date. Late assignment submissions will be deducted one letter grade per day. Late final project submissions will not be accepted or graded. Please submit early to avoid any last-minute headaches such as slow uploads, weak internet connections, or temporary system outages. If you have any technical issues when submitting, contact USC IT. It is solely the student's responsibility to ensure that all submissions have gone through on time, so please visually confirm successful submission in the system. The timestamp in the submission system is our official record: if it says you're late, you're late. You can expect grades to be posted within two weeks. Grades are non-negotiable.

Group exercises leverage your diversity of skills and life experiences. We expect each of you to contribute to your group assignments in whatever way you can create proportional value: some will be better at code, others at writing, etc. We don't intend to hold your hand: coordination and delegation are challenging but these are necessary professional skills. Organize, collaborate, and communicate proactively with one another. There will be a formal group peer review at the end of the semester to help us assign participation grades.

Review the student handbook for expectations on academic integrity. In all assignments, make sure you do not copy/paste any words, images, code, or other content written by another author (including the author of the piece to which you are responding) without quote marks and citation. If you use someone else's words, you must always use *quote* marks and *cite* them. If you refer to their ideas in your own words, you must *cite* them to make it clear whose ideas you're referring to. In an individual reflection, citing the reading's author inline is sufficient for us to understand the citation. In other contexts, use a formal reference to make your citation clear.

# Academic Conduct and Support

## Accommodations and Extensions

Any student requesting academic accommodations based on a disability or ongoing mental health concern is required to register with the Office of Student Accessibility Services (OSAS) each semester. A letter of verification for approved accommodations can be obtained from OSAS. Please be sure the letter is delivered to the instructor as early in the semester as possible, as the accommodation can only be implemented upon receipt of the letter. Visit OSAS's [web site](https://osas.usc.edu/) for more details. For further support, I encourage you to contact USC Support and Advocacy (uscsupport@usc.edu). To maintain fairness and equality for all students, extensions to due dates are only granted in accordance with these official accommodation letters. If you need to request a *one-time emergency* extension to an assignment (e.g., due to a major illness or to a death in the family) you must do the following proactively *prior to its due date*: 1) provide written documentation, such as an official doctor's note, explaining that you are unable to complete the assignment by its due date and 2) work out an extension with the instructor.

## Academic Conduct

Recording a university class is forbidden without the express permission of the instructor and announcement to the class. Recording can inhibit future free discussion and thus infringe on the academic freedom of other students as well as the instructor.

Plagiarism, presenting someone else's ideas as your own, either verbatim or recast in your own words, is a serious academic offense with serious consequences. Please familiarize yourself with the discussion of plagiarism in SCampus in Part B, Section 11, "Behavior Violating University Standards" https://policy.usc.edu/scampus-part-b. Other forms of academic dishonesty are equally unacceptable. See additional information in SCampus and university policies on scientific misconduct, https://policy.usc.edu/scientific-misconduct.
